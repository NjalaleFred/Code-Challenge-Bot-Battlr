### Setup
For this challenge one is to build an app where one is to display available bots and choose their bots. 

****

#### Core Deliverables
1. See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`
2. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The bot can only be enlisted once.
3. Release your bot by clicking on it in `YourBotArmy` component. 
4. Discharge a bot by clicking a red button marked "X", which would delete it from `YourBotArmy` and also persist the deletion.

#### Advanced Deliverables 
1. One can choose whether they want to enlist their bot in their army or just see their data. Clicking on the card displays the bot and a component `BotSpecs` should replace  `BotCollection` and in it there are two buttons one to go back and another one to enlist the bot.
2. Sort bots by either health,damage or armor. 
3. Filter bots by their class.
4. Only enlist one bot from each `bot_class`.

By satisfying the above one will be able to complete the challenge. 

**NB**: Doing the advanced deliverables is for extra practice.
